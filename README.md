# Active-Directory

The lab aims to provide a hands-on experience in setting up a virtualized environment for cybersecurity testing and exploration. Participants will create and configure multiple virtual machines (VMs) running Windows 10, Kali Linux, Windows Server, and Ubuntu Server. The lab focuses on teaching essential skills such as network configuration, security tool installation (e.g., Splunk, Sysmon), endpoint monitoring, and conducting security tests (including brute force attacks with Crowbar). Additional objectives include joining Windows machines to an Active Directory domain, enabling Remote Desktop, and automating tasks using PowerShell scripting. Overall, the lab offers practical exposure to cybersecurity concepts, tools, and techniques in a controlled, safe environment.

<h3>Tools</h3>


- Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager: For creating and managing virtual machines (VMs).
- Active Directory: For centralized domain management and user authentication.
- PowerShell: For scripting and automation of tasks.
- Splunk Server: For log analysis and monitoring, and SIEM to collect and analyze system logs.
- Splunk Universal Forwarder: For collecting and forwarding log data to Splunk.
- Sysmon: For endpoint monitoring and logging system activity on Windows.
- Windows Server 2022: For Active Directory Domain Services setup
- Ubuntu Server: As a Splunk server
- Microsoft Windows 10: As the target machine

Summary

You should now have Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager installed, along with four VMs running Windows 10, Kali Linux, Windows Server, and Splunk Server.

<h2>Phase 2</h2>


In Virtual Box, navigate to Tools > Network > NAT Networks > Create
Refer to screenshot below for configuration details


<img src="https://i.imgur.com/8Vl8gjI.png">


Click "Apply"

Navigate to each VM > Settings > Network

Refer to screenshot below for configuration details.

Repeat the above 2 steps for each VM

Navigate to each VM > Settings > Network

Refer to screenshot above for configuration details.

Next, start Splunk VM

run: ip a

this will display current IP address, which will need to be updated to static IP 192.168.10.10/24

To set a static IP on Splunk server:

Run: sudo nano /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml

tab to auto-complete, should only have one file


network: 

   ethernet:
   
     enp0s3:
       dhcp4: no
       addresses: [192.168.10.10/24]
       nameservers:
             addresses: [8.8.8.8]
       routes:
        - to: default
          via: 192.168.10.1
 version: 2

 
 Save configuration
 
Run: sudo netplan apply

Run: ip a

This will verify if IP address persists and is set to 192.168.10.10/24

Reboot

Verify connection by running: ping google.com

The steps above did not work for me as I had a different configuration file, but this turned out to be a great opportunity to troubleshoot and learn more. The configuration file on my Splunk server was 50-cloud-init.yaml, meaning our IP updates wouldnâ€™t persist after a reboot. To resolve this, I created a custom 00-installer-config.yaml file inside /etc/netplan/ and configured it with the updated IP. This ensured the static IP would remain after a reboot instead of reverting to DHCP. I also had to back up and delete the old 50-cloud-init.yaml file. Reboot and verify IP address once done.


Install Splunk

Navigate to Splunk download free trial of Splunk Enterprise

Select Linux as OS

Select ".deb" file

Save into preferred directory

Navigate back to Splunk VM

Run: sudo apt-get install virtualbox

this will display what options are available

Run: sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-additions-iso

Type "y"

Click "Enter"

Once installed, run: clear

Navigate to Devices (on the top left of the screen) > Shared Folders > Shared Folders Settings

Add a folder

Folder Path: select path where we saved our Splunk installer

Foler Name: leave as default (AD-Project in our case)

Select: Read-only, Auto-mount, and Make Permenant

Click "Ok"

In Splunk, run: sudo reboot

Once rebooted, log back in

Run: sudo adduser vboxsf

ex. sudo adduser username vboxsf

If you receive a "group vboxsf does not exist" error, we may need some additional guest installations

Run: sudo apt-get install virtualbox

This will display what options are available

Run: sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-utils

Run: sudo reboot

Run: sudo adduser username vboxsf

User should be added to group now

Create a new directory called "Share"

Run: mkdir Share

Run: ls

Newly created directory "Share" should be listed

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/lJkvpEx.png">

Next, mount our shared folder onto our directory called "Share"

Run: sudo mount -t vboxsf -o uid=1000,gid=1000 <directory name where .deb file is located> share/

ex. sudo mount -t vboxsf -o uid=1000,gid=1000 AD-Project share/

If you forget what your shared folder name is:

Navigate to Devices > Shared Folders > Shared Folders Settings

If you get an error, exit session and re-do steps

Run: exit

Error may occur because when you add your user into a new group, it may not reflect until you log out

Run: ls -la

Should now see that our "share" is now highlighted

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/rEJvr94.png">

Change directories into that share

Run: cd share

Run: clear

Run: ls -la

This will display all the files listed in this directory, including our Splunk Installer

To install Splunk:

Run: sudo dpkg -i splunk (hit tab to auto-complete)

Once you see "Complete", should be good to change into directory where Splunk is located onto our server

Change directory

Run: cd /opt/splunk

Run: ls -la

Here you will notice that all users and groups belong to Splunk, which is a good thing as it limits the permissions to that user

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/MyWKI0P.png">

Change into user Splunk

Run: sudo -u splunk bash

Now, we are acting as user Splunk

Run: cd bin

Files listed in here are all binaries that Splunk can use

the one that we will use is "./splunk start"

Run: ./splunk start

This will run the installer

Click "q"

Type "y" to accept

Select an administrator username and password

Once installation is completed:

Run: exit

To exit out of user Splunk

Run:cd bin

Run: sudo ./splunk enable boot-start -user splunk

Whenever the VM reboots, Splunk will run with user splunk
